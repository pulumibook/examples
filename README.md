# Examples from The Pulumi Book

![Pulumi Book examples build status](https://github.com/thepulumibook/examples/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

:point_up: If this badge is green, it means that all of the examples in the book are tested and working using the latest versions of Pulumi. (And if it isn't, I'm on it!)

## Welcome!

Here you'll find all of the code snippets and examples from [_The Pulumi Book_](https://pulumibook.info), organized by chapter.

The book is still a work in progress, so expect changes over the next several months.

Thanks for your interest, and stay tuned!
